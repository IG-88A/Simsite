          Hey there! My name is Hunter. I have been an avid racing fan my entire life! 
          We are so lucky to live in an age where you can experience what racing is like in the comfort of your home.
           I have built simulators as a job! I have built sim with comsure grade products all the way up to full motion sims 
           used by racing teams to give them and edge over the compitetion. <br>

           Why am I making this? A few reasons, <br>
           <br>
           1) I love to help new comers, the more people in this hobby the better. The more wheels, pedals, 
           software, on the market. Also compitetions with great payouts and prizes the better! </br>

           2) I hate to see new comers quit and sell everything becuase there is just too much information. <br>

           3) I am learning to build websites and this is a pet project. 
        </p>
        <p>
          
          NOTE: This page will focus on a PC based simulator only since it is such a flexible plat form. While console based games and sims are a lot of fun
          you are limited in options on a console (think of options and put here)

        When planning out your simulator think of where you want to place it. Do you live alone? 
        Great! Have at it! Maybe you're like me, married with pets who love to "explore". <br>
        I like using my sim late at night and making sure I dont wake up my wife and our small puppy was important to me. Sims can be loud depending on the equipment you are using.
        Luckily we have a good spare room where I can place my sim with a small desk (I work at home). Another aspect is your cables and where you will house your PC!
        If your PC is sitting on the floor, dont worry too much as long as you keep your fans and grills clean for your case. 
      </p>

      <p>Anther important aspect is space required for your displays. (Enter Link to display section here "Read more about displays here.". A set up with 3 65" monitors will take up far more space than a VR only setup. </p>

      <p>
        When building or picking a PC (if your go the pre-built route), the most powerful doesn't always fit your needs or if youre on a budget. Titles like ACC are pretty 
        demanding if you use VR for instance, but titles like iRacing and rFactor and RaceRoom usually arent in VR. The big foucs in my opinion is a smooth and steady frame rate.
      </p>  
        
         <ul>
        <li>What other uses does your PC have?</li>
        <p>Will you just be using it just for sim racing? Will you be playing other games? Do you want to edit photo and video? This are big factors whe
          it comes to selecting parts for your PC. Unless you are editing photos and video or use some of the more modern flight sims, 
          you do not need more than 16GB. </p>
        </p>

        <li>What display method are you using? Are you going single screen? VR? Triple Monitor? Wide Screen?</li>
        <p>My current PC uses a 8GB 1070Ti and runs most VR games and titles reasonably well. One of my last sim builds I had a customer that wanted triple screens on a 
          budget and using iRacing only (iRacing is not demanding by design) and gets 90-100 FPS on a Nvidia 1650.</p>

        <li>Build a balanced system</li>
        <p> If you have the budget to build an rocket ship then this wont apply to you, I am sure you will already be getting the best on the current market (I'm totally not jealous)
          Building a balacnced system means parity between your graphics card and CPU. Having something like an i9 CPU paired with a (lower tierd GPU) wont mean you have a fast PC.
          Instead of getting an i9, aim for a i7 or K series i5. Free up your budget to buy a better card. A great resource I use to check realworld performance is GPU Benchmark. 
          You can more or less build your PC and youll probably find some one with performance numbers already!   </p>

    <p>
      Think of a cockpit as a part of the foundation of your house. Your PC is the concrete slab and your cockpit is the walls. 
      Before you go and buy the most expensive cockpit think about your gear that you want use or eventually use (pedals and wheel). 
      While a cockpit made out of wood or PVC pipes is great for a gear driven wheel (Logitechs and the intro Thrustmaster wheel bases).
      On the other hand if you purchase a Direct Drive wheel, do not expect a long life out of DIY kit. <br>
      <br>
      For example, I have a Next Level Racing GT Track, while it is the top of line model for Next Level Racing, I can tell there is a tiny amount of flex on the pedal plate 
      using my load cell pedals. Is that a deal breaker for me? No. Its minimal and I feel like I can easily get the most out of my loadcell pedals. But, if I were to upgrade to say
      a set of pedals like HPPs or maybe set based off real life pedals. I may have issues. For the time being, I wont be upgrading my cockpit.<br>
      <br>
      Do research on what works best for you and the gear you want. If your want to put in the effort and homework. 
      Design your own 80/20 rig buy using (MAY CAD) or (80/20.net)<br>
      <br>
      If you need plans check out (Open Sim Racing) or check out cockpit brands that I have had great luck with as well as other sim racers
      
        <ul>
        <li>Sim Lab</li>
        <li>Next Level Racing</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
     <p>
       If you love adventure you do like many people have done and use CAD software to design your own extruded aluminum (80/20) cockpit. And of course you will need to get your own seat. 
       While you can get a purpose build racing bucket seat, main people love going to their local auto salvage and pulling from a junk car (for ALOT less money).

      <p>
        Out side of a good PC and cockpit that fits your needs. The only thing that will truly make you faster is a pedals.
         What your feet do is just as important as what your hands do. Having a pedal set with a loadcell brake and high resolution clutch and throttle pedals 
         is what should get straight out of the box.<br>
         <br>
         In my opinion the best set of pedals available at the moment is the Thrustmaster T-LCMs. They are currently around the $199 USD
         mark and have a 100kg loadcell for the brake and 16k resolution for both throttle and clutch.

    <header>Steering Wheels and Bases</header>
    <article>
      <p>
      Wheels and Wheel Bases are the modern day Ford vs Chevy. Everyone loves their brand, is loyal to their brand, and defends their brand until the end of time. 
      With thats said, wheel bases (specifically with Force Feed Back) have three different levels. Gear Drive, Belt Drive, and Direct Drive. Wh
      </p>

      <p>
       You may ask whats the difference and will they all drive same. Is complicated but not so much. The more torque or power that the wheel puts out the more detail you'll have 
       transmitted to the wheel. 
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Gear Driven</li>
          <p>Gear Driven Wheels are are found in your lower end/entry level. Wheels such as the Thrustmaster TMX (or the Playstation compatible version the T150). Another great
            option is the Logitech G923, G920 (PC and Xbox), or the G29(PC and Playstion).
          </p>
          <p>While these are entry level options they can also be great for the long term as well. I personally know people who have upgrade most aspects of their sim, expect their wheel.
